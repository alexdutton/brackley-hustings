This project aims to produce a fair and accurate transcript for the prospective
parliamentary candidate hustings for the constituency of South Northamptonshire
held in Brackley on the 9th of April 2010.

The audio recording is held separately, currently at [0]. If you'd like a copy
of the original recording (in WMA) or a transcoding thereof, please e-mail me
at [1].

If you'd like to contribute, then feel free to submit patches. I'd be very
grateful to anyone who transcribes further or can make sense of bits I can't
understand or have transcribed wrongly.

If any candidate or audience member believes that my transcription
misrepresents them or what they said I'd be happy to look in to improving the
accuracy.
